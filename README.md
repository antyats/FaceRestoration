# Face Restoration Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of current methodologies in face restoration tasks by reviewing literature from various articles. The goal is to develop a comprehensive literature review that highlights the state-of-the-art methods in the field and identify potential improvements for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of face restoration techniques.

### 3.1 First Stage
1. Literature Review
   - Study two types of articles: basic and advanced.
     - Basic articles: Initial solutions to the problem, considered classic in the field.
     - Advanced articles: State-of-the-art methods that are pivotal in solving the problem.
   - Decide which articles to reproduce for comparison with the developed solution.
   
2. Code Reproduction
   - Reproduce selected article methods and verify their functionality on specific examples.
   
3. Testing Protocol
   - Define a testing protocol for methods addressing the task.
     - Metrics, training and testing datasets, hyperparameters, validation protocols.
   - Plan visualization protocol for each method's results.

4. Method Testing
   - Test reproduced methods according to the established protocol.
   - Visualize and compare results for each method.

5. Base Code Selection
   - Determine the base code for further research within the project.

### 3.2 Second Stage
1. Method Implementation
   - Implement and reproduce a selected method using custom code for core experiments.

2. Testing and Visualization Protocols
   - Implement testing and visualization protocols using custom code.

3. Comparison
   - Compare results of the implemented method with its original version following testing and visualization protocols.
   
4. Method Analysis
   - Conduct a detailed analysis of the implemented method, identifying weaknesses and scenarios where it performs poorly.

5. Hypotheses Formulation
   - Formulate hypotheses for method improvement and describe experiments to test these hypotheses.

### 3.3 Third Stage
1. Hypothesis Testing
   - Conduct experiments to test formulated hypotheses for method improvement.

2. Results Analysis
   - Analyze experiment results and evaluate the validity of each hypothesis.

3. Final Method Proposal
   - Propose an improved method based on the results, compare it with existing methods, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
By following this structured approach, the project aims to contribute to advancements in face restoration techniques through critical evaluation, experimentation, and innovation.
